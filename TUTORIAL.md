# Learn Bash by Building a Boilerplate

> Welcome to the Introduction to Bash lessons. I know it's scary, but you can do this!

## 5. Restart Terminal

### 5.1

**The first thing you need to do is start the terminal.** Do that by clicking the "hamburger" menu at the top left of the screen, going to the "terminal" section, and clicking "new terminal". Once you open a new one, type `echo hello terminal` into the terminal and press enter.

#### HINTS

## 10. Print Working Directory
